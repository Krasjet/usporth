Î¼sporth
=======

A minimal rewrite of Paul Batchelor's Sporth [1], a small
stack-based audio programming language.

Currently work in progress.

Build
-----

First, make sure JACK is properly installed on your system.

Then use

    $ ./configure

to generate a `config.mk` file containing compiler flags,
and run

    $ make

to build the programs.
