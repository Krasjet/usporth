Î¼sporth
=======

A minimal rewrite of Paul Batchelor's Sporth [1], a small
stack-based audio programming language.

Currently work in progress.

Usage
-----

JACK interface:

  $ usporth_jack input.usp

Text interface:

  $ usporth_text [-n nsamples] [-r sr] input.usp

Build
-----

If you want to build the JACK backend, make sure JACK is
properly installed on your system.

First use

    $ ./configure

to generate a `config.mk` file containing compiler flags,
and run

    $ make

to build the programs.
